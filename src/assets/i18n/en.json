    "jetsonBasecallingDescription": "An experimental edge computing platform that deploys multiple neural network DNA/RNA basecalling models on a cluster of NVIDIA Jetson Nano devices. The project explores feasibility, performance, energy efficiency, and deployment automation of nanopore signal (FAST5) → nucleotide sequence inference at the network edge rather than relying on centralized GPU servers. K3s - lightweight of kubernetes - help a lot to manage infrastructure of cluster and container orchestration.",
    "areaMonitoringApp": "Area monitoring application",
    "areaMonitoringAppDescription": "This is an application for controlling data from monitoring areas using Ultra Wideband technology. It is a web application with an Angular framework-based interface. The server-side of the application has been developed using Java Spring Boot with a microservices architecture, and all data is managed in a PostgreSQL database. All the message to user are sending by asynchronous message queue by Apache Kafka. This is my Engineering work, and I have personally written all the code."
